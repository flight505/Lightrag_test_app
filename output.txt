Absolute neutrophil count recovery 
Artificial intelligence 

Neutropenia and its complications are major adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The time to recovery 
from neutropenia varies from patient to patient, and cannot be easily predicted even by experts. Therefore, we 
trained a deep learning model using data from 525 pediatric patients with solid tumors to predict the day when 
patients recover from severe neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy. We validated the model with data from 
99 patients and compared its performance to those of clinicians. The accuracy of the model at predicting the 
recovery  day,  with  a  1-day  error,  was  76%;  its  performance  was  better  than  those  of  the  specialist  group 
(58.59%) and the resident group (32.33%). In addition, 80% of clinicians changed their initial predictions at 
least once after the model’s prediction was conveyed to them. In total, 86 prediction changes (90.53%) improved 
the recovery day estimate.   

1. Introduction 

planning of the transplant units. 

Chemotherapy-induced  neutropenia  is  the  primary  dose-limiting 
toxicity  in  patients  with  cancer  treated  with  chemotherapy  [1].  Ac-
cording to the widely used Common Toxicity Criteria from the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI), neutropenia has four grades of severity; when it 
is < 500 /μL it is defined as grade four toxicity [2]. Because neutrophils 
respond to bacteria, viruses, and fungi, patients with neutropenia are 
more susceptible to infections. In the case of neutropenic fever, empir-
ical antibiotic treatment is required to prevent patients from progressing 
to  sepsis  [3].  Patients  treated  with  high-dose  chemotherapy  who  are 
expected to have severe neutropenia are isolated in the transplant unit 
(if the facility is available) until they recover from severe neutropenia. 
Therefore,  it is  important to approximately  predict the  day of the  re-
covery  to  prepare  for  the  individual’s  risk  of  infection  and  for  the 

Previously, predicting the recovery from myelosuppression mainly 
relied  on  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  (PK-PD)  models  and 
mathematical  modeling.  Friberg  et  al.  introduced  models  to  predict 
chemotherapy-induced  myelosuppression  using  both  drug-specific  pa-
rameters and common-to-all-drug parameters [4]. As they included the 
cell supply and feedback mechanism, their model is considered the gold 
standard  for  myelosuppression  modeling.  However,  it  requires  some 
empirically derived methods, such as a constant transit time between 
transit compartments or the mean maturation time from proliferation to 
the circulation of stem cells, which limits its application in most clinical 
cases  [5].  Several  PK-PD  models  also  improved  Friberg’s  model, 
focusing  on  specific  drugs  (6-mercaptopurine  and  sunitinib)  [6]  or 
specific protocols (NOPHO ALL-2008) [7]. Currently, multiple drugs are 
used  for  different  protocols  [8],  and  the  doses  and  concentrations  of

each drug are determined by various factors, such as the body surface 
area  and  the  patient’s  renal  function  [9].  Therefore,  it  is  difficult  to 
obtain generalized predictions using the PK-PD model. 

Several  studies  have  used  machine  learning  to  predict  absolute 
neutrophil  count  (ANC)  values.  Netterberg  et  al.  used  support  vector 
machines to predict future ANC values [10]. Cuplov et al. modeled the 
effect  of  ifosfamide  on  neutrophils  and  platelets  using  a  gradient 
boosting regression method that included an explicit interpolation of the 
data [11]. Both studies showed the potential for data-driven models to 

predict hematologic recovery; however, due to the nature of the drug- 
focused  model,  various  variables  affecting  the  recovery  from  myelo-
suppression  were  not  considered  as  factors  [12,13].  The  electronic 
health record (EHR) data contains most of the possible factors affecting 
myelosuppression  but  has  the  distinctive  character  of  irregularity  in 
terms of input interval since they are derived from the patient’s irregular 
visits to the hospital [14]. Understanding the known limitation of the 
EHR data, we aimed to find the best possible model for ANC recovery 
after  high-dose  chemotherapy  in  pediatric  patients  with  solid  tumors

the clinical artificial intelligence model [15,16]. 

Herein, we trained some state-of-the-art deep learning models and 
selected  the  best  performing  model  for  predicting  personalized  ANC 
recovery after high-dose chemotherapy in pediatric patients with solid 
tumors and compared the predictive ability of the model with that of 
clinicians. 

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Definition 

The  criterion  of  severe  neutropenia  is  an  ANC  value  < 500  /  μL, 
which  is  a  grade  four  toxicity  by  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) [2] from NCI, and this period is denoted 
by  neutropenia500.  Recovery  day,  which  is  the  predictive  goal  of  the 
deep learning model, is the first day when the ANC value becomes 
500 
/μL following at least three consecutive days of ANC values < 500/μL 
after the initiation of high-dose chemotherapy.

2.2. Study design 

The overall process of the study is summarized in Fig. 1. We followed 
the Minimum information about clinical artificial intelligence modeling 
(MI-CLAIM)  checklist  and  consolidated  standards  of  reporting  tri-
als–artificial intelligence (CONSORT-AI) checklist to report the results of 

To predict the recovery day from neutropenia after administration of 
high-dose chemotherapy in pediatric patients with solid tumors, some 
candidate deep learning models were trained with the training dataset. 
In the training process, data for 10 % of the cases were saved for internal 
validation. Tests were performed with the test dataset from cases of the 
same condition; the best performing model was then selected. To eval-
uate the performance of the model, the enrolled clinicians were asked to 
predict the recovery day from neutropenia for each case included in the 
test dataset. Participants were then asked again if they would change the 
decision after the model predicted value was given. The clinicians who 
participated  in  the  comparison  also  responded  to  the  questionnaire 
designed and developed for this study. 

The  institutional  review  board  of  the  Samsung  Medical  Center 
approved the study and waived the need for informed consent (IRB No: 
2019-11-205 & 2021-02-059). 

2.3. Data collection 

We retrospectively collected data from the clinical data warehouse 
(CDW)  at  the  Samsung  Medical  Center.  The  training  dataset  was 
collected  from  pediatric  patients  with  solid  tumors  between  January 
2000 and April 2018. The test dataset was collected from the patients 
between April 2018 and April 2020. The detailed inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria are described in Fig. 2.

Data from both the conventional chemotherapy period (before high- 
dose  chemotherapy)  and  the  high-dose  chemotherapy  period  were 
collected.  During  those  periods,  we  collected  laboratory  test  results, 
records of chemotherapy cycles with the initiation date, the actual dose 
of  administered  chemotherapeutic  agents,  prescription  of  granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), records of platelet transfusion, and 
transplanted CD34 
cell count for autologous stem cell transplantation 
after high-dose chemotherapy. The body weight and height were also 
measured to calculate the dose of each chemotherapeutic agent in the 
protocols.

2.4. Data preprocessing 

For  all  the  data  preprocessing  processes,  please  refer  to  the  Data 
preprocessing section of the supplementary material. Here, we describe 
only the unique process of dealing with the various chemotherapeutic 
agents included in our model. 

Patients received heterogeneous chemotherapy regimens with vari-
able reduction rates for both conventional and high-dose chemotherapy. 
Therefore, we created a new variable called “intensity” by multiplying 
the ratio of the actual dose to the planned dose for each chemothera-
peutic agent. There is no consistent reference to exactly how many times 
more  toxic  high-dose  chemotherapy  is  compared  to  conventional 
chemotherapy. Thus, the value was determined by the experiment. We 
repeatedly experimented with a range of numbers to find the value for 
the  best  performance.  Consequently,  we  found  that  the  model  has 
maximum performance when the value is 3. We compared the perfor-
mances with and without this preprocessing method. 

2.5. Model selection and description 

Among  the  time  series  forecasting  algorithms,  we  chose  Google’s 
temporal fusion transformer (TFT) [17] to predict the change in the ANC 
value within 30 days of the high-dose chemotherapy cycle. This model 
took the entire history including all the variables, which we mentioned 
in Section 2.3., of conventional chemotherapy for each patient as input. 
Additionally,  the  planned  high-dose  chemotherapy  schedule  and  the 
chemotherapeutic agents were provided as input. After the model pro-
vided a 30-day prediction, we calculated when the neutropenia500 ended 
from these values. We randomly selected 50 out of a total of 525 patients 
and  placed  them  aside  as  holdout  data,  and  used  this  as  the  internal 
validation dataset. The remaining data from 475 patients were used as 
the training dataset. We used the symmetric mean absolute percentage 
error (sMAPE) loss function for ANC forecasting.

candidate algorithms are shown in the Model development section of the 
supplementary material. 

2.6. Evaluation metric for model performance 

To evaluate the accuracy of the model for the prediction of the day of 
neutrophil  count  recovery,  the  proportion  that  exactly  matched  the 
actual value was calculated. Additionally, proportions that matched the 
actual values within one day and two days were calculated, respectively. 
We visually represented the difference between the actual end date of 
neutropenia500 and the model predicted end date of neutropenia500, in 
days. We assumed that showing prediction errors in days would be more 
intuitive for the clinicians. 

2.7. Validation of the model by comparison with the clinicians’ 
performance 

We enrolled 10 clinicians willing to participate in the comparison 
study through an intranet announcement at Samsung Medical Center. 
All participants were anonymized as R1 to R10 and grouped into resi-
dent  and  specialist  groups  (pediatricians  undergoing  hematology- 
fellowship  or  practicing  as  a  pediatric  hematology- 
oncology 
oncologist, with at least two to five sample sizes per group). 

For each case from the test dataset, each participant reviewed the 
data (patient conditions) and predicted the patient’s recovery day from 
neutropenia. After predicting each case, the model-predicted recovery 
day  was  revealed  to  the  participants;  they  were  again  asked  if  they 
wanted  to  change  the  estimated  day  of  recovery,  considering  the 
model’s prediction. The evaluation was performed considering the fa-
tigue and concentration of the participants. We only included the results 
of participants who evaluated all the cases. 

The  results  of  the  clinicians’  prediction  task  were  statistically 
analyzed  for  differences  between  the  resident  group,  the  specialist 
group, and the model with the best performance. The results of change 
in prediction after the prediction of the model was revealed to clinicians 
were also statistically analyzed for any trends in the number or magni-
tude of changes. 

2.8. Development and survey of the questionnaire 

We developed a new questionnaire based on the technology accep-
tance model (TAM) [18], and the details are described in the Develop-
ment of the questionnaire section of the supplementary material. All 10 
participating clinicians answered the questionnaire developed herein to 
evaluate the difference between individuals in terms of personal char-
acteristics and their beliefs regarding the data and the model. 

2.9. Statistical analysis 

We compared the predicted values of the model and human experts. 
The pairwise proportion test was used to compare groups, and Levene’s 
test [19] was used to check groups for the assumption of homogeneity of 
variance of the residuals. Bonferroni’s correction was used for multiple 
comparisons in analyses between pairwise groups. Wilcoxon’s rank sum 
test was used to compare the degree of change in prediction between the 
resident and specialist groups. Cronbach’s alpha test was used to ensure 
that the questionnaire items were appropriately correlated. Items with 
Cronbach’s alpha 
0.7 were considered as having a poor correlation 
between factors.

In  all  analyses,  the  significance  level  was  set  to  p  < 0.05.  All 
continuous  variables  are  represented  by  median  (interquartile  range 
[IQR]), and all nominal variables are represented by n (%). All statistical 
analyses were carried out using R package, version 4.0.3 (The R Foun-
dation  for  Statistical  Computing,  Vienna,  Austria,  https://www.R-pr 
oject.org). 

3. Results 

3.1. Data statistics 

For  the  two  study  periods,  data  from  525  patients  (2000–2018 
period) for the training dataset and 99 patients (2019–2020 period) for 
the  test  dataset  were  collected.  Overall,  there  were  51  variables, 
including blood cell count with differential and chemistry panels, name 
of the chemotherapeutic agents, dose of the administered chemothera-
peutic agents, platelet transfusion records, and G-CSF injection records. 
Detailed information about each variable is described in supplementary 
table 1. 

The  median  number  of  time  points  per  patient  was  102  (range 
18–244) for the training data set and 101 (range 28–237) for the test

data set. These time points were collected from the EHR. Each chemo-
therapy cycle contained a median of 15 time points; 31.3 % of the total 
time  points  were  distributed  between  days  0  and  5  of  each  chemo-
therapy cycle. Of the time points, 41.4 % were distributed between days 
11 and 20. 

Patient  demographics  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  There  was  no 
statistically significant difference between the training dataset and the 
test dataset, except for the tumor type. There were more patients diag-
nosed with brain tumors in the test data set compared to the training 
dataset (34.5 % vs 63 %, p < 0.001). 

3.2. Model performance 

Table 2 shows the performance of the best model as the difference in 
the actual end date of neutropenia500 from the model-inferred end date 
of neutropenia500  in days. For the test dataset, the model exactly pre-
dicted the end day of neutropenia500  for 24 of 99 test data (24.24 %). 
The errors within 1 day and 2 days were 76.76 % (76/99) and 94.94 % 
(94/99), respectively. 

Fig. 3 shows the performance of the model with the test dataset using 
one  chemotherapeutic  agent  as  a  single  variable,  without  using  our 
proposed method to process data of multiple chemotherapeutic agents. 
All  other  conditions  were  the  same  in  both  models,  except  that  the 
number of variables was increased to 81 in the model that treated each 
chemotherapeutic  agent  as  a  different  variable.  The  model  that  pro-
cessed chemotherapeutic agents as a single variable performed better.

covery day and the model-inferred recovery day, in days. (a) result of the 
model when data of various chemotherapeutic agents were integrated as

agents were treated as different variables. 

3.3. Validation of the model through comparison with clinicians’ 
prediction result 

Table 2 shows the result of comparing the predictive performance of 
the specialist and resident groups. The specialist group showed a better 
prediction  performance  than  the  resident  group  when  the  prediction 
error was allowed for up to 1 day (58.59 % vs 32.33 %, p 
0.001) and 2 
days (82.33 % vs 50.51 %, p < 0.001).

Data are median (IQR) or n (%). Performance is measured using accuracy with 
different levels of error. 

Fig. 4 demonstrates the comparison results between clinicians and 
the proposed model. When an error was allowed up to 1 or 2 days, the 
model showed a better predictive ability than the specialist group. The 
resident  group  showed  a  lower  predictive  ability  than  the  specialist 
group and the models for all error tolerances. 

In Fig. 4b, the resident group has a much wider dispersion of errors 
than the model and specialist groups. Similarly, errors in each group for 
each case are shown in Fig. 4c, and the specialist group and the model 
show similar oscillation trends, but the resident group oscillates over a 
much wider range.

3.4. Clinicians’ change in prediction after looking at the model’s 
prediction 

In total, 80 % of the clinicians changed their predictions at least once 
after the model’s prediction was revealed, regardless of whether they 
belonged to the specialist or resident groups. There were a total of 106 
prediction changes. Most of the change in prediction (95/106) was made 
in  the  direction  of  getting  closer  to  the  model’s  prediction,  but  some 
changes (11/106) were made in the direction away from the model’s 
prediction.  Among  the  changes  made  in  the  direction  of  the  model’s 
prediction, the prediction error decreased in 86/95 cases, but the error 
increased in 9/95 cases. All 11 changes in the prediction made further 
away from the model’s prediction resulted in further deviation from the 
correct answer.

average Likert scale scores were seen on questions such as whether to 
use a predictive model in a clinical setting, place more importance on 
subjective  thinking  at  work,  or  change  predictions  when  the  model’s 
performance is better, indicating an above-average level of agreement. 
Conversely,  questions  such  as  whether  the  introduction  of  the  deep 
learning model would undermine clinicians’  social values, undermine 
autonomy,  or  threaten  patients’  privacy  showed  low  average  Likert 
scores,  which  means  that  clinicians  disagree  with  these  questions.  In 
comparing the results between the specialist and resident groups, there 
were slight differences in predictions on privacy infringement, but there 
was no significant statistical difference overall. 

4. Discussion 

This  work  is  a  novel  attempt  to  use  deep  learning  techniques  to 
predict  a  patient’s  neutrophil  recovery  day  by  utilizing  the  patient’s 
daily monitoring data from EHR. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the  first  study  to  establish  a  model  that  can  predict  the  personalized 

recovery day for each patient. There have been several machine learning 
approach studies concerned with mortality prediction [20], prediction 
of the onset of leucopenia [21,22], or modeling myelosuppression for a 
specific single chemotherapeutic agent [11,23]; however, there are no 
studies that directly compared the model with clinicians. In this study, 
we tried to show the efficacy of the model as compared to clinicians, 
rather  than  just  showing  the  performance  of  the  model.  The  model 
performed  similarly  or  slightly  better  than  the  specialist  group  and 
showed much higher accuracy than the resident group, which showed 
large variability in prediction. Although the performance of our model 
may seem low compared to that observed in previous studies, including 
comparisons with clinicians such as reading fundus photographs [24], 
chest radiographs [25], or acute kidney injury prediction [26], it should 
be  considered  that  most  of  these  studies  were  predictions  for  binary 
outcomes  with  non-time  series  data.  In  contrast,  our  model  entailed 
predictions  for  non-binary  outcomes  with  time-series  data,  which  are 
much more difficult. Further, our model was designed to respond when 
various chemotherapeutic agents were used simultaneously, and it was

also confirmed that our proposed method showed better performance 
than the conventional method. 

Another point of interest was whether clinicians would accept the 
model’s prediction. There are several previous studies [27,28] on this 
topic, and two claim that clinicians accepted the predictions of the deep 
learning  model.  As  in  a  previous  study  [29],  we  developed  a  new 
questionnaire  based  on  TAM  and  analyzed  the  results  of  the 

questionnaire and the results of changes in the predictions of clinicians 
complementary to each other. In our study, 80 % of clinicians changed 
their prediction at least once, and 40 % changed their prediction more 
than 5 % of the total selection. This implies that the deep learning model 
can influence the decision-making ability of clinicians when the task of 
prediction  is  difficult.  When  comparing  the  specialist  and  resident 
groups, the specialist group changed their choices less frequently, and

even if they did, the difference from the original value was smaller. 

Acknowledgments 

Further,  we  observed  an  interesting  attitude  toward  accepting the 
model’s  prediction.  There  were  11  cases  where  some  participants 
changed their predictions away from the model’s prediction, resulting in 
the  worsening  of  the  original  predictions.  These  were  found  in  two 
participants,  and  they  tended  to  respond  negatively  to  “Trust  in  the 
prediction  models”  from  the  survey  designed  based  on  TAM.  Several 
studies [30,31] have reported cases where a model’s incorrect predic-
tion was followed, and inaccurate results were obtained; in our study, 
we  further  identified  cases  where  the  model’s  correct  prediction  was 
completely  ignored,  and  the  opposite  action  resulted  in  inaccurate 
outputs. 

The limitations of this study are as follows. First, this was a single- 
center retrospective study. Second, unlike adults, the incidence of pe-
diatric  solid  tumors  is  low,  and  the  indication  for  high-dose  chemo-
therapy is limited to high-risk or relapsed patients with solid tumors. 
Third, we have confirmed the possibility of accepting the model’s pre-
dictions but not the acceptance in real clinical settings. Finally, since a 
survey  was  used  rather  than  an  interview,  the  subjectivity  of  the  re-
spondents is reflected a lot, and an in-depth analysis of the reasons for 
changing predictions was impossible. Despite the above limitations, our 
model has similar predictive power to that of the best-predicting clini-
cians in our study; hence, our model is considered acceptable. 

5. Conclusions 

In this study, we used deep learning techniques to predict the time to 
recovery from neutropenia at the individual patient level and compared 
the predictive ability of the model with that of human experts. Addi-
tionally, we demonstrated that clinicians accept the results of the pre-
diction model well and that it positively affects the clinicians’ opinion. 
As a result, we found that the deep learning model shows a better pre-
dictive ability than human experts and can help reduce the prediction 
errors of clinicians.

Problem or Issue 

What is Already 

Known 

What this Paper 

Adds 

Can deep learning models predict when patients will recover 
from severe neutropenia after high-dose chemotherapy, and 
can the model’s prediction change clinicians’ predictions? 
Several attempts have been made to predict an individual’s 
ANC recovery; however, they have often been limited for 
certain drugs and lack generalized predictions [1] 
A deep learning model showed similar or better predictive 
performance than clinicians. Eighty percent of clinicians 
changed their initial predictions at least once after the model’s 
prediction. Deep learning models can predict when patients 
will recover from severe neutropenia, and clinicians showed 
high acceptability of the model
