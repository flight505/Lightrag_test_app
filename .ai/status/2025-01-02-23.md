# Session Update: 2024-01-02-23

## Development Steps

1. `pages/Search.py`: Enhanced chat interface and state management
   - Added segmented controls for search mode and prompt style
   - Improved API key handling with environment variable support
   - Implemented prompt rewriting functionality
   - Added knowledge graph visualization with detailed statistics
   - Fixed store initialization and validation logic

2. `pages/Manage.py`: Improved document management
   - Enhanced store validation using DocumentValidator
   - Fixed unnecessary reindexing issue
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

3. `project.md`: Updated documentation
   - Added recent improvements section
   - Updated file descriptions and features
   - Documented new UI/UX enhancements
   - Added knowledge graph visualization details

## Key Decisions

- Chose to use DocumentValidator for store validation instead of manual file checks to ensure robust validation
- Implemented segmented controls for better UX instead of traditional dropdowns
- Moved store selection to main content area and disabled sidebar for cleaner interface
- Added prompt rewriting option to enhance academic query formulation
- Integrated pyvis for interactive graph visualization to provide better insights

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining linter errors in `pages/Search.py`
   - Address indentation issues
   - Fix try-except block structure
   - Resolve syntax errors in configuration form

2. Enhance error handling
   - Add more specific error messages
   - Improve error recovery mechanisms
   - Add user guidance for common issues

3. Improve graph visualization
   - Add filtering options for large graphs
   - Implement node clustering
   - Add search functionality within the graph

4. Optimize performance
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Reduce unnecessary reindexing
   - Optimize graph rendering for large datasets

Progress: Successfully improved state management, UI/UX, and added knowledge graph visualization. Next session will focus on fixing linter errors and enhancing error handling.
