# Session Update: 2025-01-05-23

## Development Steps

1. `pages/Manage.py`: Updated document deletion functionality
   - Integrated LightRAG's `delete_by_doc_id` for proper document removal
   - Added progress tracking for file conversion process
   - Fixed file listing and conversion trigger logic

2. `src/file_processor.py`: Enhanced PDF processing capabilities
   - Implemented temporary directory handling for Marker output
   - Updated Marker configuration and processor setup
   - Removed unsupported processors (DebugProcessor, FootnoteProcessor, EquationProcessor)
   - Added progress callbacks for real-time status updates

## Key Decisions

- Switched to using `marker_single` command instead of `marker-pdf` for better compatibility
- Implemented temporary directory approach for file processing to ensure clean data handling
- Removed unsupported Marker processors to maintain stability
- Added progress tracking to improve user experience during file conversion

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper error handling for Marker processing failures
   - Add detailed error messages
   - Create recovery mechanisms for failed conversions

2. Enhance metadata handling
   - Improve integration with LightRAG's metadata system
   - Add validation for processed files

3. Optimize file conversion workflow
   - Add batch processing capabilities
   - Implement conversion queue management

Progress: Stabilized core PDF processing functionality and improved user feedback. Next session will focus on error handling and metadata management improvements.
