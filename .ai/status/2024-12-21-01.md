# Session Update: 2024-12-21-01

## Development Steps

1. `src/file_manager.py`: Contains functions for creating document directories and updating the `.gitignore` file to manage file storage and exclusion.

2. `pages/1_Search.py`: Implements the Streamlit interface for search and chat modes, managing session states and processing queries with progress updates.

3. `src/preprocessing_functions.py`: Provides functions to convert various document formats (docx, pptx, xlsx) to text files and manage indexed files.

4. `src/lightrag_helpers.py`: Includes helper functions for processing LightRAG responses, managing sources, and formatting responses.

5. `src/global_helper_functions.py`: Contains functions for mapping generated responses to source documents and creating traceability tables.

6. `src/Graph_query.py`: Sets up the Streamlit page configuration for querying the knowledge base using LightRAG.

7. `src/lightrag_init.py`: Manages the initialization and configuration of LightRAG, including document loading and query execution.

8. `src/local_helper_functions.py`: Provides functions for local search post-processing, mapping responses to source documents, and creating traceability tables.


## Key Decisions

- Chose to use termcolor for console output to enhance readability
- Decided to implement session state management in Streamlit for better user experience

## Next Steps

1. Need to fix directory creation and gitignore update functions, DB is main folder new store name is created in the DB. Currently they are created outside of the DB. The user need to add the txt files to the new store name folder in the DB.
2. We need to look at the preprocessing functions and make sure they are working as expected. We need to add logging to the functions and impliment them correctly. We should write tests for the functions.
