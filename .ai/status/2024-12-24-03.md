# Session Update: 2024-12-24-01

## Development Steps

1. `pages/1_Search.py`: Improved mode selection UI and functionality
   - Moved mode selection from sidebar to main interface
   - Added horizontal mode selector above query input
   - Fixed duplicate mode selection issue
   - Added proper mode parameter handling
   - Improved mode-specific settings display

2. `src/lightrag_init.py`: Simplified query mode handling
   - Removed complex fallback logic
   - Implemented direct mode selection
   - Added proper parameter passing
   - Improved error handling
   - Added better logging

## Key Decisions

- Moved mode selection to main interface for better UX
- Simplified mode handling to match LightRAG examples
- Kept mode-specific parameters in collapsible expander
- Used horizontal radio buttons for mode selection
- Maintained session state for mode persistence

## Next Steps

1. Fix No query attempts before initialization
   - this is a bug that occurs when the user submits a query before the rag_manager is initialized. 
   - we should add a check for this in the query processing code.

2. change the mode selection to st.segmented_control for the four modes
   - keep the help text 
   - there is a bug in the current select mode with radio buttons, that it reverts to the first mode when the page is rerun. 

3. add the preprocessing that convets pdf to text. 
   - this should only be dont for files that are not already in text format. 
   - for example, if the file is a pdf, it should be converted to text. 
   - or if the user adds files to the store, they should be converted to text. so we can reindex the store. 
   - track the files and their metadata and remove them from the store if they are not needed anymore. 

4. Improve mode performance:
   - pay attention to the Light rag documentation and the code, light rag options and methods will often simply our code. 
   - Add mode caching
   - Optimize parameter handling
   - Add performance metrics

5. Enhance user feedback:
   - Add mode change indicators
   - Show processing status
   - Improve error messages

6. Add mode suggestions:
   - Analyze query type
   - Suggest optimal mode
   - Add auto-mode selection

7. Implement testing:
   - Add mode switching tests
   - Test parameter validation
   - Test error handling

Progress: Improved mode selection UI and simplified mode handling. Next session will focus on performance optimization and user feedback.
