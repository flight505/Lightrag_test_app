# Session Update: 2024-12-26-02

## Development Steps

1.  `src/lightrag_init.py`: Reverted `return_source` parameter in `query` method.
    -   Removed the `return_source` parameter from `param_kwargs` in the `query` method to fix the `QueryParam` error.
    -   This change ensures compatibility with the `QueryParam` class as per LightRAG documentation.

2.  `src/lightrag_helpers.py`: Improved equation display in `format_full_response`.
    -   Modified `format_full_response` to add line breaks around `$$` delimiters for proper LaTeX rendering in Streamlit.
    -   This change improves the readability of equations in the response.

3.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Modified store selection and file processing.
    -   Reinitialized `file_processor` when a new store is selected to ensure correct file handling.
    -   Added PDF conversion during store creation to ensure all files are processed.
    -   This change ensures that the file processor is always up to date with the selected store.

4.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Added a check for LightRAG initialization before query attempts.
    -   Prevent errors when users submit queries before LightRAG is initialized.
    -   Provide clear feedback to the user if LightRAG is not ready.

5.  Implement source tracking in `src/lightrag_init.py`
    -   Explore alternative methods for source tracking that are compatible with `QueryParam`.
    -   Ensure that sources are correctly extracted and returned in the query response.

6.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Implement `st.segmented_control` for mode selection.
    -   Replace the current radio buttons with `st.segmented_control`.
    -   Maintain help text and descriptions for each mode.
    -   Fix the bug where the mode reverts to the first option on page rerun.

7.  Add more robust error handling in `src/lightrag_init.py` and `pages/1_Search.py`. 
    -   Implement more specific error handling for different scenarios.
    -   Provide user-friendly error messages with guidance on resolving issues.

8. Fixed the `QueryParam` error and improved equation display. 

## Key Decisions

-   Reverted the `return_source` parameter to fix the `QueryParam` error, Do not use  return_source=True - it does not exist..
-   Implemented a simple equation formatting solution using line breaks for better display.
-   Reinitialized the file processor on store change to ensure correct file handling.
-   Added PDF conversion during store creation to ensure all files are processed.

## Next Steps

1. when running Initialize and Index Documents on a large number of documents there it can be very slow is there a way to speed this up, some performance improvements? out machine is a macbook m3 MAX with 65 GB ram shared with MPS. 

2.  Double-check the implementation of source tracking in src/lightrag_init.py.
-   Ensure that the sources are correctly extracted and returned in the query response.
-   The global_helper_functions.py file contains the format_full_response method, which should be used to format the response. Meanwhile, the local_helper_functions.py file also contains a format_full_response method, which includes extensive code for post-processing search responses and managing traceability between generated responses and source documents.
-   It may be worth considering merging these two files into a single unified helper file for better maintainability.
-   Important: The global_helper_functions.py and local_helper_functions.py files were originally created for GraphRAG, but since we are now using LightRAG, some modifications are required to ensure compatibility and proper implementation.

3.  We need to check that the mode selection is working as expected, this meens check that the order of the modes is correct and that the mode selection is working as expected. 

4.  improve the source formatting. 

5. Add progress tracking, instead of just a simple loading spinner. we should have a progress bar that shows the progress of the query. 

6. during pdf processing, we should have a progress bar that shows the progress of the pdf processing, this should be a hook into the pdf processing code or terminal as there is a lot of processing already going on there. 

7. Create and Manage Document Store should be a separate page, this should be a separate page that allows you to create and manage the document store. 
it should have a table of all the documents in the store, with the ability to add and remove documents. use the `st.dataframe` method to create the table, with grafics for the columns should size. add a button to add a new document, and a button to remove a document.
