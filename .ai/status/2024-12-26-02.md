# Session Update: 2024-12-26-02

## Development Steps

1.  `src/lightrag_init.py`: Reverted `return_source` parameter in `query` method.
    -   Removed the `return_source` parameter from `param_kwargs` in the `query` method to fix the `QueryParam` error.
    -   This change ensures compatibility with the `QueryParam` class as per LightRAG documentation.

2.  `src/lightrag_helpers.py`: Improved equation display in `format_full_response`.
    -   Modified `format_full_response` to add line breaks around `$$` delimiters for proper LaTeX rendering in Streamlit.
    -   This change improves the readability of equations in the response.

3.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Modified store selection and file processing.
    -   Reinitialized `file_processor` when a new store is selected to ensure correct file handling.
    -   Added PDF conversion during store creation to ensure all files are processed.
    -   This change ensures that the file processor is always up to date with the selected store.

4.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Added a check for LightRAG initialization before query attempts.
    -   Prevent errors when users submit queries before LightRAG is initialized.
    -   Provide clear feedback to the user if LightRAG is not ready.

5.  Implement source tracking in `src/lightrag_init.py`
    -   Explore alternative methods for source tracking that are compatible with `QueryParam`.
    -   Ensure that sources are correctly extracted and returned in the query response.

6.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Implement `st.segmented_control` for mode selection.
    -   Replace the current radio buttons with `st.segmented_control`.
    -   Maintain help text and descriptions for each mode.
    -   Fix the bug where the mode reverts to the first option on page rerun.

7.  Add more robust error handling in `src/lightrag_init.py` and `pages/1_Search.py`. 
    -   Implement more specific error handling for different scenarios.
    -   Provide user-friendly error messages with guidance on resolving issues.

8. Fixed the `QueryParam` error and improved equation display. 

## Key Decisions

-   Reverted the `return_source` parameter to fix the `QueryParam` error.
-   Implemented a simple equation formatting solution using line breaks for better display.
-   Reinitialized the file processor on store change to ensure correct file handling.
-   Added PDF conversion during store creation to ensure all files are processed.

## Next Steps

1.  dobble check the Implementation source tracking in `src/lightrag_init.py` is working as expected. 
2.  We need to check that the mode selection is working as expected, this meens check that the order of the modes is correct and that the mode selection is working as expected. 
3.  improve the source formatting. 
4. Add progress tracking, instead of just a simple loading spinner. we should have a progress bar that shows the progress of the query. 
5. during pdf processing, we should have a progress bar that shows the progress of the pdf processing, this should be a hook into the pdf processing code or terminal as there is a lot of processing already going on there. 
6.
