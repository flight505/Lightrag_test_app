# Session Update: 2024-12-26-02

## Development Steps

1.  `src/lightrag_init.py`: Reverted `return_source` parameter in `query` method.
    -   Removed the `return_source` parameter from `param_kwargs` in the `query` method to fix the `QueryParam` error.
    -   This change ensures compatibility with the `QueryParam` class as per LightRAG documentation.

2.  `src/lightrag_helpers.py`: Improved equation display in `format_full_response`.
    -   Modified `format_full_response` to add line breaks around `$$` delimiters for proper LaTeX rendering in Streamlit.
    -   This change improves the readability of equations in the response.

3.  `pages/1_Search.py`: Modified store selection and file processing.
    -   Reinitialized `file_processor` when a new store is selected to ensure correct file handling.
    -   Added PDF conversion during store creation to ensure all files are processed.
    -   This change ensures that the file processor is always up to date with the selected store.

## Key Decisions

-   Reverted the `return_source` parameter to fix the `QueryParam` error.
-   Implemented a simple equation formatting solution using line breaks for better display.
-   Reinitialized the file processor on store change to ensure correct file handling.
-   Added PDF conversion during store creation to ensure all files are processed.

## Next Steps

1.  Implement source tracking in `src/lightrag_init.py`
    -   Explore alternative methods for source tracking that are compatible with `QueryParam`.
    -   Ensure that sources are correctly extracted and returned in the query response.

2.  Add a check for LightRAG initialization before query attempts in `pages/1_Search.py`.
    -   Prevent errors when users submit queries before LightRAG is initialized.
    -   Provide clear feedback to the user if LightRAG is not ready.

3.  Implement `st.segmented_control` for mode selection in `pages/1_Search.py`.
    -   Replace the current radio buttons with `st.segmented_control`.
    -   Maintain help text and descriptions for each mode.
    -   Fix the bug where the mode reverts to the first option on page rerun.

4.  Add more robust error handling in `src/lightrag_init.py` and `pages/1_Search.py`.
    -   Implement more specific error handling for different scenarios.
    -   Provide user-friendly error messages with guidance on resolving issues.

Progress: Fixed the `QueryParam` error and improved equation display. Next session will focus on implementing source tracking, adding initialization checks, and improving mode selection UI.
