## Project Overview
The LightRAG application is a sophisticated academic research tool that combines knowledge graph capabilities with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Key features include:

- **Advanced PDF Processing**: Uses Marker with M3 Max optimizations for high-quality PDF conversion
- **Equation Handling**: Extracts and processes LaTeX equations with unique identifiers and context
- **Reference Management**: Advanced citation pattern matching and reference tracking with validation
- **Multi-Mode Search**: Supports Naive, Local, Global, Hybrid, and Mix search modes
- **Academic Response Processing**: Formats responses in academic style with source tracking
- **Metadata Management**: Comprehensive tracking of document metadata, equations, and references

### Important Notes
- Anystyle is a critical component for reference extraction - DO NOT REMOVE OR REPLACE IT
- Anystyle is a Ruby gem, must be installed on the system. do not treat it as a python package.
- Always use pymupdf instead of fitz - fitz is deprecated.
- Marker should be used with its official Python API from marker.converters.pdf
- PDFs are preserved in the store directory until explicit deletion
- All text processing preserves semantic structure and layout


## Core Components

1. **AcademicMetadata**:
   - Structured metadata extraction from PDFs
   - Metadata for Title, Author, Reference, Abstract, year, doi, is retrived using crossref if pdf2doi returns a doi, if it returns an arxiv id then use arxiv not crossref. 
   - Equations are fenced with $$ by marker pdf conversion, the metadata that we get from marker is used for the equations. 
   - Multiple citation style support (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE)
   - Validation system with configurable levels
   - reference metadata is also retrived using Anystyle - a critical tool for accurate reference extraction, and citations are parsed using Anystyle. 
   - JSON serialization and persistence for metadata
   - The consolidated metadata from each pdf is stored in the store directory in a json file as metadata.json. If the file already exists, it is not overwritten but the new metadata is appended to the existing file.

2. **FileProcessor**:
   - PDF Processing Workflow:
     1. Metadata Extraction using pdf2doi and crossref or arxiv depending on the type of id returned by pdf2doi. 
     2. Text Extraction: Employs Marker (optimized for M3 Max) to convert PDFs while preserving layout, equations, and figures
     3. Academic Metadata Processing: Analyzes extracted text to identify and structure:
        - References (using Anystyle - a critical tool for accurate reference extraction)
        - Citations
        - LaTeX equations
        - Author affiliations
        - Abstract
     4. Results Integration: Combines all extracted data into a unified document representation
   
   Purpose: Ensures high-quality PDF processing while preserving academic content integrity, maintaining source files for reference, and enabling sophisticated search and analysis capabilities.
   
   Features:
   - Optimized Marker configuration for M3 Max
   - Fallback extraction chain for robustness
   - Progress tracking for batch operations
   - Source file preservation for validation
   - Comprehensive error handling

3. **FileManager**:
   - Database directory structure management
   - Store creation and organization
   - DB root directory gitignore management
   - Metadata file initialization
   - Directory movement and cleanup utilities

4. **LightRAGManager**:
   - Core RAG functionality with OpenAI integration
   - Multiple model support (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o1-mini, o1)
   - Configurable chunking strategies
   - Document validation and indexing
   - Query processing with temperature control

5. **DocumentValidator**:
   - File and content validation
   - Store structure verification
   - Error reporting and logging

6. **AcademicResponseProcessor**:
   - Academic formatting of responses
   - Source tracking and citation management
   - Structured response generation
   - Context-aware reference handling

7. **LightRAG Helpers**:
   - Helper functions for response processing
   - Source management utilities

## Citation and Reference Processing

1. **Citation Extraction and Linking**:
   - Multi-reference citation support (e.g., [29, 38], [32, 42])
   - Context-aware citation linking to references
   - Pattern matching for various citation styles:
     - Numeric citations (e.g., [1], [1,2], [1-3])
     - Author-year citations (e.g., Smith et al., 2023)
     - Cross-references (e.g., cf. Author, 2023)
   - Automatic reference resolution and validation

2. **Reference Processing Pipeline**:
   - DOI lookup and validation using pdf2doi 
   - use CrossRef for doi identified by pdf2doi and if it is arxiv doi then use arxiv not CrossRef
   - Author name normalization and affiliation tracking
   - Venue and publication metadata enrichment
   - Citation context preservation and analysis
   - Primary extraction using Anystyle for accurate reference parsing

3. **Integration with Document Processing**:
   - Unified processing flow between test and application environments
   - Consistent Marker configuration for text extraction
   - Standardized citation and reference extraction
   - Shared metadata handling across contexts
   - Common configuration for both test and production use
