To do:
- [ ] Fix the consolidated json file, it is not being created
- [ ] Once the consolidated json file is created, add a way to upload files to the store
- [ ] Fix the metadata that is counted in the st._data_editor (it is not being counted and just showing erroe despite the fact that the metadata is being created, number of references , citation and equations should be counted and shown in the st._data_editor)
- [ ] Once Marker-pdf is updated, to new version in should be able to get superscript as footnotes which should enable us to get the superscript citations used in some journals.
